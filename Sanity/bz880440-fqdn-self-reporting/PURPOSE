Description: Check output of hostname command
Author: Nick Coghlan <ncoghlan@redhat.com>

Some releases of RHEL return the wrong answer from "hostname -f" during
kickstart %post (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=880480)

This test is designed to be run in conjunction with a %post snippet added
to the recipe via <ks_append/> to create some files recording the state
of the networking metadata during kickstart %post execution. An example
job definition is provided as beaker_job.xml (since it appears the problem
may or may not manifest depending on details of a network's DHCP
configuration, the example XML includes a filter by lab controller
host name).
